Mission 3: Customer Support

Part 1: Debugging

To investigate Dr. V. Horrible's issue regarding the missing wire transfer for Startup X, I would start by following these steps:

Data Verification:
Check the transaction history and ledger entries associated with Dr. Horrible's account to confirm whether the wire transfer for Startup X was received.
Verify the accuracy of the bank's API data and ensure that the wire transfer is reflected in the system.

Communication:
Reach out to relevant teams or individuals responsible for handling wire transfers, such as the operations or finance team.
Inquire about any known issues or delays with wire transfers during the timeframe in question.

Investigation Questions:
Ask Dr. Horrible for additional details, such as the date and time of the wire transfer, the sender's information, and any reference or confirmation numbers associated with the transaction.
Inquire if Dr. Horrible received any confirmation or acknowledgment of the wire transfer from the bank or the sender.

Hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1: The wire transfer may have been delayed or stuck in transit due to processing issues on the sender's end or intermediary banks.
Hypothesis 2: There could be a discrepancy in the account information provided by Dr. Horrible or the sender, leading to the wire transfer being routed incorrectly.
Hypothesis 3: The wire transfer might have been flagged for review or held for compliance reasons, such as suspicion of fraudulent activity or insufficient documentation.

Falsification:
To falsify Hypothesis 1, check with the sender or intermediary banks to confirm the status of the wire transfer and track its progress.
To falsify Hypothesis 2, verify the accuracy of the account details provided by Dr. Horrible and cross-reference them with the sender's records.
To falsify Hypothesis 3, review the bank's compliance protocols and investigate any flagged transactions or alerts associated with Dr. Horrible's account.
By systematically investigating these aspects, we can identify the root cause of the missing wire transfer and take appropriate action to resolve the issue.
